#Assembly development for c.h.i.p. computer

The cheapest general purpose computer platform in the history of mankind is here. Let's prepare the terrain for the next billion people that could access the information revolution. And let's hope that many of them are going to be more than simple information consumers.

The c.h.i.p. computer is powered by an ARM Cortex A8 processor. There are many interesting features that hardware designers have prepared and assembly is the key to unleash them.

#Assembly, really?
Actually, assembly is living a renaissance thanks to the ubiquity of the ARM processor on the mobile space and on internet of things platforms. A passion in many ways similar to that of mid nineties for the x86 assembly.
The fact is that coding programs for ARM in assembly is easy. One click and your code turns into a tiny executable that simply runs. No need for virtual machines nor big, buggy libraries. Unless you want them. From assembly it is possible to use a library written on any language, any functionality proportioned by the operating system and take advantage of the whole hardware potential. But, what's the catch?
There is a steep learning curve. You need to know the way the machine works, the different instruction sets, the calling conventions, the way to access memory and a lot of other interesting niceties.
I think that the best way to climb that stair is a hands-on approach. Starting from a simple working program and build upon it. I am just tarting to climb and this is my journey's logbook.
